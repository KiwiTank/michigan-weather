# Plotting weather trends
This was a project to plot weather trends over a decade in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The data comes from NOAA, and the aim was to compare the temperature observations for 2015 with those seen over the previous decade. 

This project leveraged my skills in data cleaning and organisation, followed by plot creation and customisation in matplotlib.
